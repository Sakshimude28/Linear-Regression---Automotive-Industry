This project involved assisting a car manufacturer in designing a more fuel-efficient vehicle to boost sales.
I used data cleansing techniques to ensure high-quality data for analysis. A linear regression model was built to predict miles per gallon (MPG) based on vehicle attributes, 
identifying key factors that influence fuel efficiency. I also compared model results using forward and backward selection methods. 
The final recommendations provide actionable insights for the manufacturer on which attributes to prioritize in future car designs.


Data Dictionary:

MPG -> Miles Per Gallon. Typically, the higher the number, the more fuel-efficient the vehicle is
Cylinders -> The efficiency of how the motor goes through fuel, the more the more efficient
Displacement -> Size of the motor
Horsepower -> How powerful the motor is. Typically, the more horsepower, the less efficient
Weight
Acceleration -> How fast does it take the car to get to 100 MPH
Model Year
US Made
